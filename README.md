:test_tube: Work In Progress(WIP)
- This is a work-in-progress inventory system made using HTML/CSS for the UI and Lua for the logic.
I’m sharing this early to get feedback, ideas, and potential contributors. It’s fully functional and modular, and I’m actively improving it.

- While many people prefer React, I chose HTML/CSS for performance and simplicity — especially for server owners looking for easy edits.
Open to ideas, improvements, and even collabs!
